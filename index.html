            <p>The workshop will connect the domains of Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) with that of Computer Vision by establishing a common ground of interaction and identify shared research interests. These topics will be presented from the dual lens of Computer Vision and AEC, highlighting the limitations and bottlenecks related to developing applications for this specific domain. The objective is for the two communities to come together and solve problems that are relevant in the AEC community, such as understanding the construction sites as it is changing, as well as automatically generating building models from scans of real data.</p>

<p>This workshop will also host the first Scan-to-BIM challenge focused on key problems when converting 3D point cloud data obtained using lidar, photogrammetry, or depth map cameras to Building Information Models (BIMs). BIMs represent different elements of a building in a semantically rich manner, identifying objects, associated attributes, and geometrical and topological relationships. AEC firms and public agencies create BIMs to design new buildings and other structures; however, BIMs are rarely available for existing buildings or facilities. For maintenance, retrofitting, or renovation AEC entities could greatly benefit from access to BIMs of their facilities, because interpreting 2D as-built drawings is very time consuming and leads to many errors and omissions. Furthermore, asset owners could use BIMs for operations and maintenance as BIMs enable storing and having access to attributes such as maintenance history, material type, manufacturer specifications among others.</p>

<p>However, current computer vision evaluations are mainly done on familiar evaluation metrics such as Intersection-over-Union (IoU) or classification accuracy, rather than metrics that are more relevant in practice in the AEC community, such as geometrical and topological connections between different spaces and openings. This challenge aims to bring the computer vision, civil engineering, geomatics, and construction communities together by creating new tasks and evaluation metrics that can be tackled by computer vision researchers while being of interest to and fulfilling the objectives of the AEC community. </p>

				<h4 class="section-heading text-uppercase text-center" style="margin-top:100px">Dataset</h4>
				<p>The dataset is available <b><a href="https://deepreality.allvision.io/">HERE</a></b>. You will need a registered account to download the dataset. Once you submit a request for registration, it will be inspected and a registration link will be sent to you within 24 hours. The challenge contains a total of 31 buildings with multiple floors each and dozens of rooms on each floor. Of which, 20 buildings are designated as the <i>training</i> set, with a total of 49 point clouds. The validation and testing 
sets contain 5.5 buildings with 21 point clouds each. For each model, there is a point cloud in LAZ format. For the training and validation sets, a corresponding floorplan aligned with the coordinate system of the point cloud is also provided.
				<br>	<b>NOTE: </b> If you have downloaded 
				the data prior to May 3rd noon PT, please note that we have an updated version of the data, with the CAD model coordinates aligned with the input point cloud, which has replaced the original version.</p>
				<p><b>Floorplan Reconstruction Task:</b> For the floorplan reconstruction task, the <i>training set</i> consists of the point clouds of 20 buildings with multiple floors each, with a total of 49 point clouds, as well as corresponding 2D building models for each floor with multiple extracted layers. These layers include: walls, curved walls, doors, windows, stairs, and columns. The buildings have complicated floor structures which could include dozens of rooms, curved walls and many doors on each floor. We have released 6 new buildings as the <i>validation set</i> and another 6 as the <i>testing set</i>. The <i>validation set</i> contains point clouds and their corresponding 2D building models. For the <i>testing set</i>, only the point clouds will be made available, while the 2D building models will not be made available and we will host a server to evaluate the submissions.

				<p> <b> NEW (May 12th) </b> The validation and testing sets have been released! </p> 
				<!--<p><b>Floorplan Reconstruction Task:</b> We provide 2D building models for each floor described as both a binary OBJ file and a JSON file with extracted layers. These layers include: walls, curved walls, doors, windows, stairs, and columns. A detailed description of the file format can be found <a href="filespecs.html">here</a>. We will have 6 buildings as the <i>validation</i> set and another 6 as the <i>testing</i> set. The validation set, which contains point clouds and their corresponding 2D building models, will be made available on a later date. The testing set models will not be made available and we will host an evaluation server to evaluate submissions.-->
				<!--<p>We provide API to extract layers from dwg and convert to obj or JSON file in this
					<a href="https://github.com/cv4aec/cv4aec.github.io/tree/main/conversion_api">package</a>. Please find use examples
					under main.ipynb file. The file formats for obj and JSON are detailed below.</p> -->
				<p><b>3D Building Model Reconstruction Task:</b> For the 3D building model reconstruction task, the <i>training set</i> consists of point clouds of 4 buildings with multiple floors, as well as the corresponding 3D building model in AutoCAD DXF format. We aim to release 2 more buildings for the <i>validation set</i> and 2 more as the <i>testing set</i>. The evaluation on the testing set will also be hosted on the evaluation server in a similar manner to the floorplan reconstruction task.</p>

				<p><b><i>(Note that you will get an email within 24 hours after requesting to register for an account.
					After you receive confirmation, please use the emailed link in the confirmation email to register your account. Following this, you can download the Scan-To-BIM training set for the two tasks. The building models for the 3D reconstruction task are also available in separate files.)</i></b></p>
				
				<p style="margin-top:10px"><b>File Specifications:</b> A description of the file formats and sample code to read/write these files can be found <b><a href="filespecs.html">HERE</a></b>.

				<h4 class="section-heading text-uppercase text-center" style="margin-top:100px">Metrics</h4>
				<p>We will include metrics to evaluate the reconstruction of the walls, doors, floor area and windows.</p>
			<p><b>Geometric Metrics:</b> We will evaluate the:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><i>IoU</i> of the each room (a room is defined as a completely separated area with walls and doors).</li>
				<li><i>Accuracy of endpoints</i>. Precision/Recall and F-measure will be evaluated in the coordinate system of the point cloud. The provided endpoints will be matched with the Hungarian algorithm to the point cloud, and every point that is within a certain threshold will be determined as a match.</li>
				<li><i>Orientation</i>. For each matched line between the ground truth, we will compute the cosine similarity metric between them as the normalized dot product. If a line is not matched with ground truth, the cosine metric will be zero. Finally, the metric will be averaged over all the ground truth lines.</li>
				<p><b>Topological Metrics:</b> We will also evaluate topological metrics that measure whether the connectivity of the rooms match the ground truth. The main metrics will be warping error (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5539950">Jain et al. 2010</a>) and Betti number error. 
				The warping error will first warp the predicted floorplan to the ground truth with a homotopic deformation, and then compute the pixels that cannot match after the deformation. The Betti 
				number error will compare the Betti numbers between the prediction and the ground truth and output the absolute value of the difference.</p>

				<h4 class="section-heading text-uppercase text-center" style="margin-top:100px">Evaluation and Submission</h4>
				<p> The evaluation code for the 2D floorplan task is available from <a href="https://github.com/seravee08/WarpingError_Floorplan">This GitHub Repository</a>. For 3D, because of the difficulty to come up with correct ground truth and have a consistent file format that is 
					acceptable to both the computer vision and AEC communities, we have decided that we will use an expert panel to evaluate the submissions manually. We will aim to have automatic evaluations for the challenges in next years.</p>
				<p>Submission of results on the testing set and evaluation on the ground truth data is now available on the <a href="http://deepreality.allvision.io">evaluation server</a>. For 2D, the submission will be
			           in the same JSON format as in the ground truth provided to you. For 3D, the submission will be in DXF or Wavefront OBJ formats.</p>
